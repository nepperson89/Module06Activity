## Purpose of the Site
This site serves as an interactive web application for an educational module aimed at mobile user interface design using jQuery Mobile. It demonstrates mobile UI components such as page transitions, list views, panels, and form submission within a single HTML document. The application is an informational guide themed around fruits, allowing users to access sections on apples, oranges, and grapes each containing descriptive images and lists. One of the most impressive features is a user form housed in a slide-out panel which allows the user to enter their first name, favorite fruit, and a reason for their choice.

## Buttons & User Interactions
In the front page features a button named "Open Panel". When the button is pressed, it reveals a sliding panel from the side of the window which has form provided for the user. This panel can also be closed by clicking outside the panel, pressing the escape key or swiping.
Users are able to provide their information such as First Name, Favorite Fruit and provide an explanation as to Why it’s their favorite. “Reset Button” clears the input fields and the “Submit Button” tries to calls the form data to the back end script, if there is one.
At the top header, there’s a navigation list with “Go to the Apple Section”, “Go to the Orange Section” and “Go to the grapes section”. Each of these can be clicked and will take you to the appropriate subpage which has relevant content.
All fruit sections pages (Apple, Orange, Grapes) have a Back button at the bottom of the page. The Back button will take you to the Main Page.
### Description of Each Section:
- In the Apple Section, there will be an image of an apple and a ordered list of the top 5 varieties of apples.
- In the Orange Section, there will be an image of an orange and what it looks like inside the orange when sliced. There will also be an unordered list of the health benefits of an orange.
- In the Grapes Section, there will be an interactive filterable list of the various types of grapes. The user can type into the list’s search bar and only the relevant types will be returned.
